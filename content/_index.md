## Call to action

The United States Supreme Court is not upholding our constitutionally protected rights!

No State has the authority to take our federally protected right to live from us!

Secure our rights now!

Throw out the unfounded USSC decision ruling No. 19-1392 on the basis of having now constitutional merit!

Our Supreme Court has overstepped!

Remind the USSC what it means to uphold our Constitution(a.k.a. their job)!
